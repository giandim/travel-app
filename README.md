# Travel App

A simple vacation trip management application.<br>
My primary objective in creating this app is to thoroughly test and experiment with the latest updates on React Native Expo, but also to use on my next trip ðŸ›«.<br>
The initial implementation will be limited to Japan with subsequent upgrades aimed at providing destination customization options for users.
